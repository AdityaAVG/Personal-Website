        <h1>My Journey: From a Village to Building the Future</h1>
        
        <p>I grew up in a remote village where <span class="highlight">basic infrastructure</span> like internet, electricity, and even water supply was a luxury. Despite these challenges, my curiosity to understand how things work never wavered. I didn’t have access to computers, but I was driven by a fascination for technology. When the pandemic hit, we finally got internet, and I realized the <span class="highlight">power of connectivity and knowledge.</span></p>

        <h2>Early Engineering Mindset</h2>
        <p>Even before the internet arrived, I was always finding creative ways to solve problems. I once tried to root my father's smartphone, hoping to boost its RAM to play PC games. It failed, but it taught me about hacking and system architecture.</p>
        <p>At 10, I was fascinated by a glue gun but couldn’t afford one, so I built my own using materials like a heating coil from a mosquito repellent. This DIY approach was a theme throughout my childhood. For example, I once experimented with <span class="highlight">passing AC current through water</span> to heat it, which ended in a pretty big explosion and smoke-filled house! My parents weren't thrilled and the greater surprise was when electrician asked my dad if someone died of that incident.</p>

        <p>I also built various tools like a foam cutter from nichrome wire, a soldering iron,an Arduino-based alarm system and a human following rover inspired by a space tech movie (but couldn't really finish it because I was out of budget). I’m always challenging myself, whether it’s through building new devices or solving complex problems with limited resources. This foundation inspired me to pursue larger and more impactful projects.</p>

        <h2>Entrepreneurial Drive</h2>
        <p>I don’t just solve technical problems, I think strategically. I've cold-mailed countless business leaders, unicorns, and decacorns with ideas for improving their products, increasing and diversifying revenues, and suggesting expansion strategies. These efforts helped me understand <span class="highlight">the startup ecosystem</span> from a unique perspective.</p>
        <p>I believe in the power of collaboration and mentorship.I’m always seeking new ways to contribute to the tech world, especially in emerging fields like AI, blockchain, and quantum computing.</p>

        <h2>Innovation, Discipline, and Vision</h2>
        <p>When I’m not coding or hacking together new inventions, I find inspiration in the gym or even while resting. These moments of calm help me brainstorm fresh ideas and solutions. My commitment to self-improvement extends to everything I do, whether it’s in tech, business, or life in general.</p>
        
        <p>Here are a few domains that I’m passionate about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>AR/VR – Immersive experiences are the future of human interaction.</li>
            <li>Quantum Computing – Pushing the boundaries of what’s computationally possible.</li>
            <li>AI & Deep Learning – The backbone of tomorrow's intelligent systems.</li>
            <li>Blockchain – A decentralized, transparent future.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>As an engineer and entrepreneur, I’m always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow. I’m ready to take my ideas to the next level and <span class="highlight">turn them into products</span> that can impact millions of lives. Let’s connect and build something remarkable together.</p>
