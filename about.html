        <h1>My Story: From a Village to Tech Dreams</h1>
        
        <h2>Where I Come From</h2>
        <p>I grew up in a small village where we didn't have many things people in cities take for granted. We didn't have good internet, manytimes the electricity would go out, and even getting clean water was hard. But these challenges didn't stop me from being curious about how things work, especially when it came to technology.</p>

        <h2>My First Steps into Tech</h2>
        <p>Even though I didn't have a computer, I was always trying to figure things out. Here are some things I did:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I tried to make my dad's old phone faster by rooting it,so I could play games on it. It didn't work, but I learned a lot about how phones work.</li>
            <li>When I was 10, I really wanted a glue gun but couldn't buy one. So I made my own using parts from other things around the house.</li>
            <li>I once tried to heat water using electricity. It caused a big explosion and filled the house with smoke! My parents weren't happy .The incident was so dangerous that even the electrician said someone must have died of it.</li>
            <li>I made other things too to keep working with electronics which I couldn't afford, like a tool to cut foam, my own soldering iron, an alarm system using a small computer called Arduino and worked on  human following robot (but couldn't complete due to lack of funds.).</li>
            <p>I started learning to code on my phone. The internet in my village was very slow, but I would walk around trying to find spots with better signal. I learned about something called Machine Learning from a course I got after winning a competition. That's how I got into AI and ML.Then I got into LLM's, Ethical Hacking, Hardware and AR development.</p>
        </ul>

        <h2>How & Why I Started Coding</h2>
        <p>I didn't start coding until I was almost done with high school. I watched a lot of videos about people who started their own companies and their mindset and opinions about changing world. It made me think: <span class="highlight">"What if I could build something that helps lots of people?"</span></p>

        <ul>
            <li>In free time ,I send business proposals to diferent companies ,pitching them some ideas for further expansion or increasing revenue.Most of them ignore me though thinking I am a teenager.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What I am currently working. </h2>
        <ol>
            <p>A call bot to automate the sales calls.</p>
            <p>A platform for youtubers to reduce time for content creation by automating the repetitive tasks involved in video editing, thumbnail creation, Single click upload etc.</p>
            <p>AR glasses (haven't started ,in research phase)</p>
        </ol>
        <p>Though I am very passionate about this stuffs but It is really hard to keep working on internet from my village.It takes around 50 attempts to just clone a github repo because the internet keeps crashing in between</p>
        <p>I get really frustated sometimes becauase I am not even able to work on my favourite things because of some out of control factors.But now I feel that I can change this factor.</p>

        <h2>My Big Dreams</h2>
        <p>Now, I have lots of ideas about what I want to do in the future:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make AR glasses that can replace smartphones ,eventually the physical screens.</li>
            <li>Work on really fast computers called quantum computers</li>
            <li>Use AI to help find new medicines and edit genes</li>
            <li>Make smart cities automated by robots and AI</li>
            <li>Build a super-fast car that doesn't hurt the environment (sustainable fuel)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>What I'm Looking For</h2>
        <p>I know these are big dreams, but I believe with hard work and the right help, I can make them come true. I'm looking for people who believe in me and can guide me. If you're someone who starts companies or invests in new ideas, I'd love to talk to you. Maybe we can work together to build something that makes the world a little better.</p>
        <p>Also I am looking for some funds to move out of my village ,maybe to a better place like SF or BLR to work with some differently thinking and ambitous people ,working in collaboration with them.I you feel you can help me in any way like travel fare,<a href="payment.html" class="section-link"> fund me with some money</a> or host me, I would be very grateful for that.</p>
