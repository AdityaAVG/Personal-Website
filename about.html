        <h1>My Journey: From a Village</h1>
        
        <p>I grew up in a remote village where <span class="highlight">basic infrastructure</span> like internet, electricity, and even proper water supply. Despite these challenges, my curiosity to understand how things work never wavered. I didn’t have access to computers, but I was driven by a fascination for technology. When the pandemic hit, we finally got internet, and I realized the <span class="highlight">power of connectivity and knowledge.</span></p>

        <h2>Pre Internet Life & Early Engineering Mindset</h2>
        <p>Even before the internet arrived in my life (which was in pandemic in summer of 2019), I was always finding creative ways to solve problems. I once tried to root my father's smartphone, hoping to boost its RAM to play PC games. It failed, but it taught me about hacking and system architecture.</p>
        <p>At 10, I was fascinated by a glue gun but couldn’t afford one, so I built my own using materials like a heating coil from a mosquito repellent. This DIY approach was a theme throughout my childhood. Like, I once experimented with <span class="highlight">passing AC current through water</span> to heat it, which ended in a pretty big explosion and smoke-filled house! My parents weren't thrilled and the greater surprise was when electrician asked my dad if someone died of that incident.</p>

        <p>I also built various tools like a foam cutter from nichrome wire, a soldering iron,an Arduino-based alarm system and a human following rover inspired by a space tech movie (but couldn't really finish it because I was out of budget). I’m always challenging myself, whether it’s through building new devices or solving complex problems with limited resources. This foundation inspired me to pursue larger and more impactful projects.</p>

        <h2>How and Why I learnt Coding</h2>
        <p></p>Till mid of 12th grade,I was more focused on acing exams ,Competitive exams in India to enter college. I use to watch video interviews of people on YouTube and ended up watching bunch of videos about entreprenuership,building future and founder videos. This changed my mind to work for something impactful. I still remember the line that impacted me the most - </p>
        <p>How this century would be if Bill Gates and Steve Jobs were not born in last century.</p>
        <p>The thing here is how one can create an impact that bends everyone's future.That's what I want to do. Atleast build some useful things for people.</p>
        <p>I started coding from my smartphone,from a place with almost no internet,in around Feb of this month.I would take my phone and walk around my village to places where I could get a better speed(max speed was 100kbps) but that speed was just for a moment. I learnt ML from a course which I got from a business pitching competition for my pitch. Thats how my journey in AI/ML started.</p>
        <h2>Entrepreneurial Drive</h2>
        <p>One of my habits in free time is to pitch business strategies. I've cold-mailed countless business leaders, unicorns, and decacorns with ideas for improving their products, increasing and diversifying revenues, and suggesting expansion strategies. These efforts helped me understand <span class="highlight">the startup ecosystem</span> from a unique perspective.</p>
        <p>I believe in the power of collaboration and mentorship.I’m always seeking new ways to contribute to the tech world, especially in emerging fields like AI, blockchain, and quantum computing.</p>

        <h2>Vision</h2>
        
        <p>Here are a few domains that I’m passionate about and want to do in future:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>AR/VR – I am more interestd in replacing physical displays or screens with the augmented one's like AR glasses with voice ,gesture and muscle movement based controls.</li>
            <li>Quantum Computing –In my bucket list to build or contribute in building Quantum Computer.</li>
            <li>AI & Deep Learning – I want to use this tech for productivity and in Biomed field.In Biomed, I am more interested about genomics(gene editing) and drug discovery</li>
            <li>Blockchain – A decentralized, transparent future.</li>
            <li>A smart city which has majority of things automated by Robotics and AI</li>
            <li>A hyper car run by sustainable fuel.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>I’m always looking for opportunities to grow. I’m ready to take my ideas to the next level and <span class="highlight">turn them into products</span> that can impact millions of lives. Let’s connect and build something remarkable together.</p>
