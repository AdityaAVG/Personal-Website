        <h1>Fund My Journey to San Francisco</h1>
        <h2>I won't get anything If I don't even ask for it.</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Aditya, and I'm on a mission to pursue my dreams in San Francisco. I'm looking to raise some money to make this journey possible. Here's how I plan to use the funds:</p>
        <p></p>
                <ul>
            <li>Flight tickets & Visa: $1,500</li>
            <li>Accommodation: One of my friend is willing to host me there.</li>
            <li>Living expenses (food, transportation,internet): $200/month</li>
            <li>This would support me in the intial days ,until I figure out my way through hackathon and building great stuff.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A good and very ambitous peer is what I am looking for.</p>
        <p>If you feel, Why do I deserve it then <a href="about.html" class="section-link">read my ambition and vision.It is really frustating to not even being able to work on your passion because of some inevitable factors but I want to change it.</a></p>
        <h2>Worst Case Scenario</h2>
        <p>One of YC video titled "Should you start a startup" mentioned if you are ready to live with the worst case scenarion then go for it</p>
        <p>I might get deported back to India or even run out of money before achieving something , But I will surely learn enough and improve myself in the process and try to build something big and impact people in a good way.I am ready for it and want to take risk to achieve something big.</p>
        <p>Your support will help me take this crucial step towards my goals. I'm passionate about solving problems and building things that could help people in any way possible, and San Francisco offers unparalleled opportunities specially a very ambitous peer group. With your help, I can connect with industry leaders, attend important events, and potentially build something great.</p>
        <p>Every contribution, no matter how small, brings me closer to this dream. Thank you for considering supporting my journey!</p>
