        <h1>Predicting Quantum Properties of Organic Molecules using Neural Networks</h1>

        <p>This project explores using neural networks to predict the <strong>Quantum Mechanical Properties</strong> of organic molecules. By leveraging the power of machine learning, we aim to enhance the understanding of molecular interactions and their biochemical behavior, which can have significant applications in <strong>drug discovery</strong> and molecular biology.</p>

        <p>Our approach uses <strong>Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNN)</strong> to process molecular graphs and predict quantum properties, focusing on how atoms (nodes) and bonds (edges) in a molecule interact and share information.</p>

        <h2>Dataset: QM9</h2>
        <p>We utilize the <strong>QM9 dataset</strong>, which contains data on <strong>130,000 molecules</strong> with <strong>13 quantum mechanical properties</strong> for each molecule. These properties were predicted using <strong>Density Functional Theory (DFT)</strong>, a popular but computationally expensive quantum mechanics simulation method.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Key Phases of the Neural Network Model</h2>

        <h3>1. Message Passing Phase</h3>
        <p>In this phase, the model simulates the interaction between atoms. Each node (atom) receives and processes messages from its neighboring nodes, updating its <strong>hidden state</strong>. The exchange of information continues over multiple iterations, allowing the network to model how atoms influence one another.</p>

        <h3>2. Readout Phase</h3>
        <p>Once the message-passing phase completes, the <strong>readout function</strong> aggregates information from all nodes (atoms) and edges (bonds) in the graph. The final prediction, representing a specific <strong>quantum property</strong> of the molecule, is made from the processed data of the entire graph.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Analogy</h2>
        <p>In the context of the molecular graph representation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Nodes</strong> represent <strong>atoms</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Edges</strong> represent <strong>bonds</strong> between the atoms.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2>Models Used and Research Papers</h2>

        <h3>1. CNN for Learning Molecular Fingerprints</h3>
        <p>Learns information from both nodes and edges but separately. Fails to capture the interaction between nodes and edges.</p>

        <h3>2. Gated Graph Neural Networks (GGNN)</h3>
        <p>Enables nodes in the graph to exchange information with each other over several steps. Combines updated node states for final prediction.</p>

        <h3>3. Interaction Networks</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Message Function:</strong> Generates messages by combining hidden states of connected atoms and bond types.</li>
            <li><strong>Update Function:</strong> Updates the hidden states of atoms.</li>
            <li><strong>Molecule-level Output:</strong> Combines all atom and bond information to predict properties like molecular stability and energy levels.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Molecular Graph Convolutions</h3>
        <p>Updates atom info as well as the molecular info during the message phase. Helps the model learn how molecules behave by understanding how atoms and bonds influence each other.</p>

        <h3>5. Deep Tensor Neural Networks</h3>
        <p>Uses the "tanh" function to pass short, smooth, and manageable messages between atoms.</p>

        <h3>6. Laplacian-based Methods</h3>
        <p>Uses CNN on graphs by passing messages through nodes using Eigenvectors.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Accuracy Benchmarks</h2>
        <p>We measure performance against:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>DFT error</strong> – Error compared to DFT predictions.</li>
            <li><strong>Chemical accuracy</strong> – Quantum chemical accuracy of predicted properties.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2>Work Still Going On</h2>
        <div class="work-progress">
            <p>The next stage involves fine-tuning the models with the QM9 dataset to enhance prediction accuracy for drug discovery applications. Key areas of focus include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Improving model convergence during training.</li>
                <li>Exploring different graph neural network architectures to optimize prediction.</li>
                <li>Testing the generalization ability of models on unseen molecules.</li>
                <li>Integrating additional molecular datasets to broaden predictive power.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Further developments and implementation updates will be shared soon!</p>
