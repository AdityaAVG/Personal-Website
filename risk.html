        <h1>Why Take Risk if not Solely for Success</h1>
        <p>My opinion about taking risk is different.</p>
        <p>Risk taking is not about getting success because it is not guaranteed that you will succeed after taking risk but one sure thing is that you will improve yourself a lot.You will develop a mindset to tackle the hardest problems which are often more risky .The so called most successful are called successful not because  they earned a lot of money but rather they have dealt with such problems .</p>
        <p>Take risk for a new version of yourself not to get successful .This mindset will give you more courage to be a risk taker and not be afraid of failure ( which prompts you from taking risk ) </p>
        <p> Why we are afraid of taking risk .The reason is not failure but the notion of failing even after putting all the efforts scares us the most.This is true for everyone and even I have felt it ."What if it failed even after my all efforts " this thought scares the most but you will have upgraded yourself to the level that the next chapter of your life will be comparatively easy and will you an advantage of moving fast .</p>
        <p>One of the best line I heard till now is </p>
        <p>You + Energy + Going All In = Enough to succeed</p>
        <p>Going All In </p>
        <p>You can convert a risk into reward by putting all your efforts but with a mindset to learn and improve yourself because if you do not enjoy your work and be curious to learn more about it , you will not last for long and lasting longer (persistence) is what you want to achieve your goals.</p>
