    <h1>RNN & LSTM Networks</h1>
    <pre>RNN is Recurrent Neural Networks 
        LSTM is Long Short Term Memory

    RNN is a kind of neural network but with loop i.e info from one neuron is passed on to the next neuron.
    </pre>
    <pre>
        It can be thought as multiple copies of same network with message passing to a successor. 

        RNN are capable of learning short term dependencies.
        LSTM are kind of RNN but with capability of learning long term dependencies.

        Their default behaviour is to remember information for long period of time.
